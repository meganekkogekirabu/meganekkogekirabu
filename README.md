I speak English and (TOCFL 2) Mandarin. I'm currently studying data science.

I have a homepage on [Nekoweb](https://choi.nekoweb.org/) and you can find the source code for it [here](https://github.com/meganekkogekirabu/choi.nekoweb.org).

Can't figure out the top languages widget, but I mostly write C(++) and Rust nowadays.
